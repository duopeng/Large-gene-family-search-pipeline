# Pipeline built to search members of large gene families in Pacbio/Nanopore genomes


## Getting Started

##### Folder Structure:
```
+ [folder]scripts_for_pacbio_genomes:
++ [folder]scripts : scripts used to do family search

+ [folder]scripts_for_Nanopore_genomes: 
++ [folder]all_and_full: input gene family sequences
++ [folder]genomes: genome assemblies to search in
++ [folder]scripts: scripts used to do family search
++ [folder]family_search_batch.py
++ [file]family_search_batch.py: this is the main script, running it will produce a folder containing everything needed to run an instance of family search
```
